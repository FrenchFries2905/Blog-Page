The concept of casteism or societal hierarchy has existed in almost all civilizations. The English word caste (/kɑːst, kæst/) derives from the Spanish and Portuguese casta, which, according to the John Minsheu's Spanish dictionary, means "race, lineage, tribe or breed. With the start of the industrial revolution, the entire structure of societal hierarchy began to change from top to bottom. Although some nations may have banned the idea on papers, it still existed as de facto practice among most Aristocratic societies in Europe and was not completely rooted out until the beginning of the industrial revolution. In this article we will talk about European Feudalism and its history.
 
Let us first start with its history.
The feudal system did not emerge in isolation but was influenced by several earlier societal and economic structures that provided the foundation for its development. These precursors arose from a mix of Roman traditions, Germanic customs, and broader socio-economic conditions.
In ancient Rome, the patron-client system was a deeply ingrained societal structure. A patron, typically a wealthy and influential individual, provided protection, financial support, or other forms of assistance to their clients, who were individuals of lower status. In return, clients owed services, loyalty, and sometimes military support to their patron. The relationship was hierarchical, but obligations were mutual. The patron was the protector, sponsor, and benefactor of the client; the technical term for this protection was patrocinium. Although typically the client was of inferior social class, a patron and client might even hold the same social rank, but the former would possess greater wealth, power, or prestige that enabled him to help or do favors for the client. These relationships set the stage for the personal loyalty and obligations that later characterized the bonds between lords and vassals in the feudal system. Additionally, the economic dependency of clients on patrons mirrored the reliance of vassals and serfs on their lords for land and protection. The idea of patronage spread outside the Roman empire when influential Romans, such as Caesar and Augustus, established client–patron relationships in conquered regions. This can be seen in Caesar’s relations with the Aedui of Gaul wherein he was able to restore their influence over the other Gallic tribes who were once their clients. Civic patronage became particularly important during the late Roman Republic and the early Empire, as the central authority expanded and local communities sought to navigate their relationships with Rome. A city or community might choose a wealthy senator, equestrian, or other influential figure as its patron to advocate for its interests, provide legal representation, or ensure economic and political stability.
Patrons often used their resources and influence to benefit the communities they represented, such as funding public works (e.g., temples, baths, roads, or aqueducts), organizing festivals, or providing relief during times of famine or crisis. These acts of generosity were not purely altruistic; they served to enhance the patron's reputation and secure loyalty and support from the community. This system reinforced the social hierarchy, as patrons derived prestige and political influence from their role.
The jus patronatus is an extension of the Roman patronage, adapted for the Christian Church. A patron who funded or established a religious institution (such as a church or monastery) held certain rights and responsibilities over it. Christianity also played a pivotal role in the development of the feudal system. The early medieval Church, already highly organized and hierarchical, provided a model of structured relationships that influenced feudal society. Bishops, abbots, and monasteries controlled vast tracts of land and often acted as feudal lords, granting land to vassals in exchange for services. The Church also provided moral and theological justification for the feudal order, emphasizing mutual obligations between lords and vassals as part of a divinely ordained social hierarchy. The concept of the Great Chain of Being, where every individual had a God-given place in society, reinforced the legitimacy of feudal relationships.

Parallel to the Roman traditions, Germanic tribal customs played a crucial role in shaping feudalism. Germanic tribes that settled in Europe during and after the decline of Rome organized themselves around chieftains who commanded loyalty from their warriors, known as the comitatus. Warriors pledged their allegiance to their chieftain in exchange for protection, leadership, and a share of the spoils from raids and conquests. This deeply personal and reciprocal relationship between leader and follower influenced the concept of vassalage, where knights served lords in return for land. Furthermore, early Germanic practices of landholding, often communal or allodial, eventually transitioned into the feudal system’s structured land tenure tied to service obligations.

The nomadic and tribal societies that interacted with Europe also provided influences that shaped feudal structures. Groups such as the Huns, Avars, and early Slavic tribes organized themselves around personal loyalty to a leader in exchange for protection and resources. These systems of reciprocal relationships and localized authority bore similarities to the feudal contracts that later defined European medieval society.

From the brief introduction to the history of its precursors, one can notice how they were in a sense, the foundation of the medieval feudalism. The idea only evolved from here into a much more sophisticated and oppressive framework, intertwining social, economic, and political relationships in a way that concentrated power in the hands of the few while binding the majority to a system of dependency and subjugation. 

The feudal system was a highly structured and hierarchical organization that defined medieval European society, operating as both a socio-political framework and an economic order. At its core, the feudal hierarchy revolved around the ownership and distribution of land, which was the primary source of wealth and power in the agrarian economy of the Middle Ages. The relationships within this hierarchy were based on mutual obligations, with each tier bound to the one above or below it by ties of loyalty, service, and protection.
At the top of the feudal hierarchy stood the monarch, who was often regarded as the ultimate owner of all land within the kingdom. The king's authority was considered divinely sanctioned, lending legitimacy to their rule. To govern effectively and secure their realm, monarchs granted large tracts of land, known as fiefs, to the highest-ranking nobles, including dukes, earls, and barons. These nobles became the king’s vassals, swearing oaths of fealty that required them to provide military support, financial contributions, and counsel in exchange for their fiefs. The relationship between the monarch and their vassals was deeply personal and symbolized the reciprocal nature of feudal obligations.
Below the high-ranking nobles were the lesser nobles, such as knights and lords, who were granted smaller parcels of land by their overlords. These individuals were often vassals themselves, serving the nobles above them while acting as lords to those beneath them. Knights, in particular, were a crucial component of the feudal hierarchy, providing armed service in exchange for their fiefs. This level of the hierarchy was marked by a military ethos, with knights adhering to the code of chivalry and playing a key role in defending the realm and enforcing the authority of their lords.
At the base of the feudal hierarchy were the peasants, who made up the vast majority of the population. These individuals were divided into two main groups: freemen and serfs. Freemen were tenant farmers who paid rent or provided services to their lord in exchange for the right to work the land. Serfs, on the other hand, were bound to the land and legally obligated to provide labor, a portion of their harvest, or other forms of service to their lord. While serfs were not considered slaves, they had few rights and little opportunity for social mobility, living under the constant obligation to their local lord. In return, they were offered protection and access to land for subsistence farming, which anchored them firmly to the manorial estate.

The Church occupied a unique and powerful position within the feudal hierarchy, often operating parallel to the secular structure. Bishops, abbots, and other high-ranking clergy controlled vast estates and wielded influence comparable to that of nobles. The Church not only acted as a landowner but also provided spiritual justification for the feudal order, promoting the idea that each person’s position in society was part of a divine plan. Monasteries and dioceses often functioned as feudal lords, collecting tithes and rents from their dependents and contributing to the cultural and intellectual life of medieval Europe.


The deeply entrenched social order, reinforced by religious doctrine and cultural norms, made rebellion not only difficult but often viewed as morally wrong or sacrilegious. The majority of the population, particularly peasants and serfs, lacked the resources, organization, or military strength needed to challenge their superiors effectively. Their lives were closely tied to the land and their immediate community, leaving them dependent on their lord for protection and sustenance, even under harsh conditions.Monarchs, on their part, used their position as ultimate landowners and their ability to grant or revoke fiefs to maintain loyalty among their vassals. They often played rival lords against each other, ensuring that no single noble gained enough power to mount a serious challenge. Moreover, the Church played a critical role in discouraging rebellion by emphasizing the divine right of kings and the moral imperative of obedience to one’s superiors.


Despite these barriers, revolts did occur, particularly during periods of political instability, economic hardship, or perceived injustices. For example, peasants sometimes rose up against their immediate lords during times of famine, excessive taxation, or exploitation. Such revolts, however, were usually localized and easily suppressed due to the lack of broader coordination. Among the nobility, rebellions against the monarch were often triggered by disputes over succession, grievances over royal interference in feudal rights, or dissatisfaction with the distribution of power. These conflicts could escalate into larger civil wars, such as the Wars of the Roses in England or the numerous feudal rebellions in France
