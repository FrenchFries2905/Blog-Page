I’m Adeen aka Saud online. On this blog, I share thoughts on history, astronomy, psychology, technology, and other ideas that interest me. I believe in learning from the past and believed it is our duty to honor the sacrifces of our ancestors through remeberence and admiration of history, I also try  understanding the world around us, and finding meaning through reflection. Life is uncertain, but knowledge helps bring clarity. Feel free to contact me for any questions related to my articles or to just discuss a topic through my twitter.
