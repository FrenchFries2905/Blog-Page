![A Nenet speaks about his lifestyle](/Blog-Page/nenet6.jpg)

Nenets are nomadic indigenous people of Siberia. Numbered less than 50 thousand today, they are a very reserved ethnic group that has no interest in leaving their lifestyle and integrate into the modern world. The live in the tundra and taiga of northern Russia, mostly around the Yamal peninsula. Their regions are intersected by major rivers like the Ob and Pechora and bordered by Arctic seas. This gives them the opportunity for fishing and hunting and also provides the source of fresh water. They practice animism and shamanism, believing in spirits of nature, ancestors, resources of land and land it self. 


The thing I find most interesting about them is that in their culture, Reindeer herding and husbandry is the most important. Since they practice animism, reindeers hold a deeply spiritual and cultural significance in their lives. However, the most interesting part about it is that eat raw reindeer meat and drink their blood. When i heard about it first i refused to believe it, I mean every ethnic group is familiar with fire no matter how remote, why wouldn't they cook it? and if they did eat the meat raw, wouldn't that make them prone to all sorts of diseases?. I saw some documentaries about it and they did infact eat raw meat and drink blood of Reindeers. It was so fascinating to watch, i will link the videos at the end of the article. Apparently Eating raw meat, particularly the liver, provides essential nutrients like vitamins and minerals, Reindeer blood is also rich in iron and other nutrients, which are difficult to obtain in the tundra's harsh conditions. And the Nenets are not the only group that consume raw meat, many other indigenous article people do the same.
Their bodies have adapted to consuming raw meat over generations through a combination of physiological and cultural adaptation. There may be genetic adaptations, though less well-documented, that allow Arctic populations like the Nenets to thrive on high fat, protein rich diets and to process raw foods without adverse effects. I would very much love to know how their body has adapted and is different to ours specially in terms of digestion, but at the same time it would be unethical to just pick one of them and run all sorts of test on them, unless they consent that is but that would be hard to do, what would you say to convince them? "Its for Research of your anatomy and how your body works", first of all they speak the Nenets language (yes that's what its called), which belongs to the Samoyedic branch of the Uralic language family, so it would take a while to learn their language to communicate our message, and even after conveying our message, how would one explain to them words such as anatomy when it is not in their vocabulary. This may sound very challenging but luckily not all Nenets are completely primitive, some have attended Russian schools and are aware of what goes on in the modern world. It would be very interesting for both us and them, for us we would know of their body while for them they would have very interesting and peculiar stories to tell of the world outside the tundra, specially because Nenets culture is rich in oral traditions, including storytelling and songs. Imagine a Nenet describing all sorts of medical machinery and buildings and cars and whatnot to his tribesmen under an aurora.

However their nomadic lifestyle has not been unaffected by the acts of outside world. Unfortunately for them, the Yamal Peninsula holds some of the largest untapped gas fields in the world which have become central to Russia's energy strategy. The massive infrastructure projects, including pipelines, roads, and extraction facilities has started encroaching the tundra which is the main source of their livelihood and culture. These developments have fragmented the reindeer pastures which is essential for their herding practices, making it increasingly difficult for them to maintain their migration routes and access traditional grazing areas. Many Nenets have been compelled to settle in villages, often facing challenges in adapting to a sedentary lifestyle, losing their language, and experiencing cultural disconnection. 


So should similar ethnic groups be rooted off their traditions and cultures passed down from generations for the "greater good" of a nation? and should they just be integrated into the civilized society and their cultures and traditions reduced to lines on the pages of a history book like hundreds of other ethnic groups in the past?. I think we ought to care more for these marginalized indigenous nomadic groups by leaving them be just as we have left north sentinel island. And honestly their lifestyle is ideal, (totally not biased by Ted Kaczynski) that is if you were born into it, you cannot adapt to these lifestyles by just living as them after living in the industrial society for various reasons.
