I saw an American version of the Venice Flag and absolutely loved it and decided to make more with the theme and made this. Not exactly what i had in mind but it's alright, afterall i picked Ottomans for the task and couldn't really use Islamic symbolism on it for religious purposes, there isn't any proper symbolism anyway unlike Christianity. 
Having Symbolism in a Religion has its ups and downs. Having means it is more prone to Blasphemy with those symbols which is pretty common with Christianity. 

That is why I plan on using Islamic Geometric designs as a sort of Islamic Symbolism in the future. I absolutely adore them. Perhaps I will post some of my favorite designs this week.
